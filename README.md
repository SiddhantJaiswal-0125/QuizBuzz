# Quiz-App

A Mobile Application where the admin can upload questions and can provide pictorial representation too and the required students/candidates can give their test.
Although the topics can be changed by changing the Firestore data for really any other types of quiz.
Going with Flutter is a easy choice with its quick development time and fast execution times.
Firebase as the backend and storage solution makes it very easy to scale and change all the quiz subjects.
The biggest challenge was getting the Oauth to work in Google services and Firebase login.
